# Luxart Vehicle Control v3 Lite
Over the past months, I have been slowing integrating additonal features into Faction's release (v2.0) of Lt. Caine's Luxart Vehicle Control resource, I would now like to release these to the public. 

## Additional Functionality:

__LuxHUD:__ 
A small togglable and adjustable visual representation of the scripts functionality modeled after real siren controllers. Includes 3 position switch, siren, horn, takedown, and lockout textures. Includes ability to move and save location and opacity of HUD.

__Adjustable Manual / Auxilary Tones:__
Change which tone to use for each manual tone (primary and secondary) as well as the auxiliary tone. These are also saved to the client requiring no changes at relog.

__Hazards Delay:__
Customizable "Hold-to-activate/deactivate" hazard lights to prevent accidental activation when navigating trainers/vMenu.

__Hazards SoundFX:__
Added activation/deactivation sound effect of toggle switch based off IRL vehicle toggle switches.

__SETTINGS.lua:__ 
One stop shop for all customizable settings to reduce server developer workload.

## How to install:
1. Download the latest stable (or beta if you're brave) from the release section on the right side.
2. Add lux_vehcontrol_lite folder into your server resources.
3. Add `ensure lux_vehcontrol_lite` or `start lux_vehcontrol_lite` to server.cfg

__If you DO NOT stream commonmenu.ytd with another resource:__

4. Keep the stream folder present, you don't need to move or change a thing. Continue to step #6.

__If you stream commonmenu.ytd with another resource (for example to stream custom vMenu textures):__

4. Navigate to `lux_vehcontrol/extras/RawTextures` add all textures to other resource's commonmenu.ytd. 
5. Remove or Rename `commonmenu.ytd` from stream folder to prevent overriding othe resource's commonmenu.ytd. 
6. Open SETTINGS.lua and configure to your liking. Install any additional tones you would like to enable locally.
7. Enjoy!
