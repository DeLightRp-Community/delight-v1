I’ve made this script for a server which I used to develop for around a year ago, unfortunately though, the server has died before even having a go at using the script, originally it was meant to work with the ESX framework only, but I’ve decided to convert it to be a standalone script, the reason why I made this script in the first place was because I’ve seen a similar one which was/is paid 7, so I preferred to give it a go myself as I was pretty sure I could recreate it myself.

Anyway, enough backstory for the origin of this script.

Here’s a quick and nasty showcase of the script: https://youtu.be/y_QYMiO0vJ8

Also, don’t use this code to make yet another paid version of this :)
