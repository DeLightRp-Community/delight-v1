# zqueue (WIP DON'T USE)

### Priority queue for zdiscord

This is a FiveM server queue with discord based priority built on [VikingTheDev](https://github.com/VikingTheDev/)'s pQueue work to support zdiscord instead.
You **NEED** [zdiscord](https://github.com/zfbx/zdiscord) for this resource to work.

# Installation
Copy or download the resource in your resource folder, and add `ensure zqueue` to your `server.cfg`


# Credit

Great thanks to [VikingTheDev](https://github.com/VikingTheDev/pQueue) ♥ who originally build this resource for use with sDiscord and sPerms under the MIT License before I ported it to use zdiscord.
This modified version of the resource will also stay open source under MIT for improvements and inspiration to others.
