# QB-GC-VehicleKeys
GC-VehicleKeys converted to QB-CORE
I have had this for a while now and can not remember where i sourced it from, all i have done is maintained it for my personal use with qb-core,
if you use this please take out qb-vehiclekeys from the main qb resouce folder and take a back up just in case you dont like the above edit^.
Vehicle hotwire you do not need to have a tool for this so you can hotwire any car for free can be changed.

Updates:

Thank you to just JoshYouJust for chaning the PlayerPedId().
I have also cleaned up the script a lttle more ie hiding required items to howwire as these are disabled as default ( howwiring is free )
