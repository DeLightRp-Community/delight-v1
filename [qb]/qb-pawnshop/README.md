## qb-pawnshop

Edit of qb-pawnshop for ANZ Gaming Networks. 



## What I've changed with this version: 
-Converted to a player ran store. 

-Reverse billing system (Store pays out the customer based on what items they have).

-Reverse billing system ^ payouts to customer comes out of society funds.

-Money earned from selling items out back of shop goes back into society funds.

-Employee commission payments on all sales.

-Employees can trade the items in out the back of shop for a profit.

-Complete with boss menu setup, fully functioning job.

-Duty toggle.

-Stash Tray for viewing customers items they want to pawn.

-Integrated with qb-target (fully setup within qb-pawnshop, nothing to add).

-Removed the melting process and coding.

-Added new items to purchase within config set up for our server (Can easily be changed to suit your own)

-Pawn Shop is set up for job 'sydpawn', you will need to change this if wanting to use a different one.
