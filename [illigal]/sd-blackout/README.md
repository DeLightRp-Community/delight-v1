# Installation

Add this item to your qb-core/shared/items.lua
```
['c4_bomb'] = {['name'] = 'c4_bomb', ['label'] = 'C4 Explosive', ['weight'] = 1000, ['type'] = 'item', ['ammotype'] = nil,['image'] = 'weapon_stickybomb.png', 	['unique'] = true, 		['useable'] = false, 	['description'] = 'A high-yield, timed explosive charge..'},
```
Then you're done and good to go! 

# Dependencies

qb-core
qb-target 

(Since a lot of the code is standalone, all you realistically need is the target and qb-weathersync)
